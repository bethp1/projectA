						<p>Stieg Larsson was born in Vasterbotten in northern Sweden in 1954. At the time of his birth, his parents were too young and too poor to keep him, so he was raised by his grandparents in a small village in the north of Sweden. Stieg’s grandfather, Severin Boström, became the male role model for the young Stieg. Severin was strongly anti-fascist. Had he been Danish, he would no doubt have been placed in a German Concentration Camp. The fate of his grandfather deeply affected and shaped Stieg’s character. He wanted to protect equal rights and fight for democracy and freedom of speech in order to prevent history, and what happened to his grandfather, from repeating itself. Stieg Larrson passed away from a heart attack in 2004. The manuscripts for the Millenium trilogy were found after his death and were published shortly after. The Millenium trilogy was made into film apdations in Sweden, and an american movie of the first book in the trilogy was later relased.</p>

								<p>Starting his investigation, Mikael realizes that Harriet’s disappearance is not a single event, but rather linked to series of gruesome murders in the past. He now crosses paths with Lisbeth Salander, a young computer hacker, an asocial punk and most importantly, a young woman driven by her vindictiveness.</p>

					<p>David often writes about major talents who refuse to follow convention. He is interested not only in what it takes to stand out from the crowd, but also in the resistance that such creativity and iconoclasm inevitably attract. <i>I am Zlatan Ibrahimović</i>, written by David in collaboration with the Swedish football star, was published in 2011. This revealing memoir is probably the most successful book in Sweden in modern times. It sold 500,000 copies in hardback in less than two months. Reviewers hailed it as both a masterpiece and a future classic. <i>I am Zlatan</i> has encouraged a new generation to read – one that had previously not been addressed by the publishing market. David regards that as one of the finest things ever to have happened to him. To date, <i>I am Zlatan</i> has been published in over 30 languages around the world. Millions of copies have been sold in all. Ian Herbert of The Independent in the UK described it as ‘the most compelling autobiography football has known’. <i>I am Zlatan</i> was shortlisted for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year award, the most highly esteemed award for sports writing.In Sweden it was the first book of its kind to be nominated for the prestigious August Prize, a literary award named after August Strindberg. In December 2013 David Lagercrantz signed a contract with the Swedish publishing house Norstedts and Moggliden AB, the company that oversees Stieg Larsson’s literary estate, to write a new instalment in Larsson’s Millennium crime fiction series featuring Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist.  </p>

The series that began with <i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</i> continues as brilliant hacker Lisbeth Salander teams up with journalist Mikael Blomkvist to uncover the secrets of her childhood and to take revenge.</p>
 
						<p>Lisbeth Salander—obstinate outsider, volatile seeker of justice for herself and others—seizes on a chance to unearth her mysterious past once and for all. And she will let nothing stop her—not the Islamists she enrages by rescuing a young woman from their brutality; not the prison gang leader who passes a death sentence on her; not the deadly reach of her long-lost twin sister, Camilla; and not the people who will do anything to keep buried knowledge of a sinister pseudoscientific experiment known only as The Registry. Once again, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist are the fierce heart of a thrilling full-tilt novel that takes on some of the world’s most insidious problems.</p>
